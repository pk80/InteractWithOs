# Qwiklab Assignment:
# Imagine one of your IT coworkers just retired and left a folder of scripts for you to use. One of the scripts, called
# emails.py, matches users to an email address and lets us easily look them up! For the most part, the script works
# great â€” you enter an employee's name and their email is printed to the screen. But, for some employees, the output
# doesn't look quite right. Your job is to add a test to reproduce the bug, make the necessary corrections, and verify
# that all the tests pass to make sure the script works! Best of luck!
#
# What you'll do
#
# - Write a simple test to check for basic functionality
# - Write a test to check for edge cases
# - Correct code with a try/except statement
#
# cat ~/data/user_emails.csv
# cat ~/scripts/emails.py
